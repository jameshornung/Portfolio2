			<p class="bio-content">Hailing from a small town nestled in the piney woods of East Texas, James came to Austin to attend the University of Texas, and his love of Austin has kept him here.  He has bartended on Sixth Street, lifeguarded at Barton Springs Pool, cooked crawdad's at the Boiling Pot (where he met the girl that would eventually become his wife), and slung burgers at Waterloo Ice House.</p>

			<p class="bio-content">Eventually, James left the glitz and glamour of the service industry behind to serve as a math tutor at a Southeast Austin junior high school where he conducted initiatives to enhance student's understanding of the math curriculum.  From here, he transitioned into the billing department of a local startup company. James has worked as a billing specialist for public and private ambulance companies for the last seven years.</p>

			<p class="bio-content">When not at his computer James enjoys: live music; training for marathons; participating in the Austin Runners Club; practicing yoga; watching Longhorn sports, and enjoying all the things Austin has to offer.</p>
